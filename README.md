## Funding Circle Code Challenge

To install the mocha testing framework, run the following command in the terminal:
```
npm install
```

To run 

```
npm start
```

This runs both driver code itself and the tests. (They are enclosed together for size and simplicity sake).

### Notes


* Time Complexity: Î˜(n)^2

* Speed: ~15ms

I don't see a way to reduce complexity of the multiplication table. The functions "printTable" and "MultTable" could be combined, but that would reduce readability without gaining much in the way of speed.
